  fileText: "[Lab Documentation - Creating the 'key.txt' File]\n\nSubject #4179,
    to access secured areas within the virtual environment, you must create a 'key.txt'
    file in your 'inventory' directory. Follow these steps to create the file and
    populate it with different passcodes:\n\n1. Access your 'inventory' directory:\n  
    - Locate the 'inventory' folder and double-click to open it.\n\n2. Create the
    'key.txt' file:\n   - Right-click within the 'inventory' directory.\n   - Select
    'Create' and choose 'Text Document.'\n   - Rename the newly created text document
    to 'key.txt'.\n\n3. Edit 'key.txt' with various passcodes:\n   - Double-click
    'key.txt' to open it with a text editor.\n   - Enter passcodes, one per line,
    like this:\n\n   Passcodes:\n   - 4319\n   - 8926\n   - 5764\n   - 1097\n   -
    2458\n\nRemember that the 'key.txt' file is essential for accessing secured areas
    and solving puzzles within the virtual environment. The first code you'll need
    is '4319.' Use it wisely to progress further in your quest to regain control.\n\nBest
    of luck on your journey."
